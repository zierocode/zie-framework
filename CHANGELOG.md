# Changelog

## v1.30.0 — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **context-loader-sprint**: Session-scoped command map cache via `zie_context_loader.py`, integrated into `session-resume.py` with session cache and mtime-gate invalidation
- **context-load-smart**: Deduplicate context loading across skills — `load-context` skill owns cache logic, reviewers use `context_bundle` passthrough, ROADMAP cache hints
- **agent-mode-compat**: Document non-Claude limitations (`model:`/`effort:` frontmatter ignored, `--agent` flag unavailable), add `/implement` direct fallback pattern (ADR-066)

### Fixed

- **Test suite cache alignment**: Unified all cache tests to use `CacheManager` instead of file-based caching — removed `test_subagent_context_hash_cache.py`, updated `test_hooks_subagent_context.py`, `test_hooks_auto_test.py`, `test_reviewer_skill_adr_cache.py`
- **Hook path references**: Updated `test_nudges_stop_guard.py` and `test_hook_events.py` to reference `stop-handler.py` (renamed from `stop-guard.py`)
- **session-resume exception handling**: Added stderr logging for pattern load and pending marker cleanup exceptions (no bare `except: pass`)

### Tests

- 2556 tests passing (1 skipped)
- Integration tests: 59 passed, 1 skipped

## v1.29.0 — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Mega Sprint: 14 Phases — Lean + Efficient + Autonomous zie-framework**
- **auto-learn**: Pattern extraction from sessions, session memory JSON in `zie-framework/memory/`, `pending_learn.txt` marker for next session
- **auto-decide**: Proactive suggestions via PostToolUse hook (test failure → `/fix`, spec complete → `/plan`, plan complete → `/implement`); frequency cap: max 3/session, 5min cooldown
- **auto-improve**: Auto-apply high-confidence patterns (≥0.95) to `MEMORY.md` at session start; WIP context injection from previous session
- **unified-context-cache**: Centralize ROADMAP/ADR caching with session-scoped TTL in `hooks/utils_cache.py`
- **content-hash-ttl-increase**: TTL increased 600s → 1800s with session-id salt for cache invalidation
- **test-lookup-caching**: Cache test→source mapping in `.zie/cache/test-cache.json`
- **sprint-context-passthrough**: Phase 1→2→3 context bundle eliminates redundant disk reads
- **intent-pattern-single-pass**: 65 regex checks → 1 combined regex with named groups
- **command-map-pre-load**: Cache command map in `plugin-state.json`, invalidate on `SKILL.md` change
- **reviewer-context-enforcement**: `context_bundle` required for all reviewer skills
- **stop-handler-merge**: Consolidated 3 Stop hooks → 1 (`hooks/stop-handler.py`)
- **pre-computed-version**: Version computed at sprint start, stored in `.zie/sprint-state.json`
- **combined-nudge-checks**: Single git log pass for all nudge checks

### Tests

- 34 new unit tests for auto-* features (`test_post_tool_use.py`, `test_session_stop.py`, `test_session_resume_auto_improve.py`)
- All 14 phases shipped with passing tests

## v1.28.2 — 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Test flakiness from cache TTL** — `test_hooks_subagent_context.py` now clears content-hash cache before each test to avoid TTL-based skip (600s TTL caused false negatives on repeated runs); added `clear_content_hash_cache()` helper and `decisions/ADR-000-summary.md` fixture

## v1.28.1 — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Non-Claude fallback for /release** — advisory message for non-Claude providers, `make release-local` target documented, inline `model:` comments removed from release.md + impl-reviewer/SKILL.md

### Fixed

- **Model routing tests** — updated model-routing-v2 tests to reflect non-Claude compatibility changes from ADR-066

## v1.28.0 — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Non-Claude model compatibility** — safety_check_agent now reads `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` env var for model resolution; detects model-unavailable CLI errors and falls back to regex evaluation (fixes critical security gap under Ollama Cloud)

### Fixed
- **Security: all commands defaulting to ALLOW** — when Claude CLI returns a model-unavailable error, parse_agent_response() no longer defaults to ALLOW; evaluate() now catches RuntimeError and falls back to _regex_evaluate()

## v1.27.0 — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **`make zie-implement`** — run /implement in fresh agent context, same pattern as `make zie-release`; sprint Phase 2 now uses this instead of non-existent `Skill(zie-implement)`
- **Sprint "all means ALL" rule** — every item must appear in audit table; no silent drops; item consolidation requires explicit `[MERGED]` notice listing original items and reason

### Fixed
- **Sprint Phase 2 Skill call** — `Skill(zie-framework:zie-implement)` does not exist as a skill file; replaced with `make zie-implement` (agent mode via Bash)
- **Self-approve via Write/Edit** — sprint Phase 1, spec-design autonomous mode, and spec.md `--draft-plan` were instructing direct `approved: true` writes blocked by reviewer-gate; all three now use `python3 hooks/approve.py`
- **spec.md `--draft-plan`** — missing `Bash` in `allowed-tools` and missing plan-reviewer step before approval; both fixed
- **Version bump bias toward patch** — release Step 1 now explicitly states minor bump is required when ANY new user-visible capability ships; patch only when ALL items are fix/refactor/chore/docs

### Changed
- ADR-000-summary trimmed to 1580 words (limit: 1600)
- README: added missing `using-zie-framework` skill entry

## v1.24.0 — 2026-04-12

### Features

- **WIP=1 guard in /implement** — pre-flight step 2 checks Now lane; stops with "WIP=1 active: '<task>'" if a task is already in progress, preventing accidental parallel work
- **Event field length caps** — `sanitize_log_field` gains `max_len=10240` parameter; stopfailure-log and notification-log now cap oversized fields to prevent disk exhaustion from unbounded event-controlled input
- **Reviewer-pass marker handshake** — `subagent-stop.py` writes a `/tmp` marker when a reviewer agent returns ✅ APPROVED; `approve.py` warns (non-blocking) if the marker is absent, confirming the reviewer ran before approval
- **Effort routing (ADR-063)** — `brainstorm` and `spec-design` skills lowered from `effort:high` → `effort:medium` for Sonnet 4.6; ADR-063 documents the low/medium/high routing table
- **Parallel retro ops** — `retro.md` now instructs ADR writes and ROADMAP Done update to run as parallel tool calls (different target files, no race condition); ADR-000-summary update follows after both complete
- **ADR-062** — once-per-session `/tmp` flag pattern documented for hooks that should fire exactly once per session

### Fixed

- CLAUDE.md line limit raised to 87 (was 82) to accommodate 5 new commands added in v1.23.0

## v1.23.0 — 2026-04-12

### Features

- **3-tier context warnings** — compact-hint.py upgraded to 3-tier system: soft hint at 70% (once/session), recommendation at 80%, hard warning at 90%; each tier fires only once per session via `/tmp` flags to prevent nag repetition
- **Brainstorm skill** — 4-phase discovery skill: reads project context, researches via WebSearch (≤6 queries), synthesizes + presents, writes `.zie/handoff.md` for sprint pickup; sets `brainstorm-active` flag so stop-capture defers
- **Conversation capture** — `design-tracker.py` UserPromptSubmit hook detects design signals (≥2 hits) and writes `design-mode` flag; `stop-capture.py` Stop hook captures session intent to `.zie/handoff.md` on session end
- **Session continuity** — session-resume.py reads `.remember/now.md` WIP buffer and prints first non-heading line as "Last session:" context at startup
- **Framework self-awareness** — session-resume.py: PROJECT.md staleness check vs git commit mtime, command map from SKILL.md, backlog nudge from ROADMAP Next lane; Playwright CVE-2025-59288 minimum version guard (1.55.1)
- **Intent intelligence** — intent-sdlc.py: short-message gate (`<15 chars` always exits), brainstorm pattern detection, idle-gate for sprint scoring (only fires when `active_task=none`), threshold scoring for fix/chore/sprint intents (≥2 signals)
- **Adaptive learning** — session-learn.py records stage+timestamp to `pattern-log.jsonl` on every session stop; rebuilds aggregate every 10 sessions; intent-sdlc.py reads aggregate to suppress pipeline-position guidance for experienced implement-stage users
- **Sprint reliability** — `/sprint` writes `.sprint-state` JSON after each phase checkpoint; detects incomplete sprint on restart and offers resume/restart; state deleted on successful retro completion
- **Code quality gate** — `quality-gate.py` PreToolUse:Bash hook fires on `git commit`; warn-only checks: coverage data presence, dead-code signals in staged diff, optional bandit scan; always exits 0
- **Reviewer-pass marker** — `subagent-stop.py` writes `/tmp` marker when reviewer agent returns ✅ APPROVED; `approve.py` warns if marker absent (ensuring reviewer ran before approval)
- **New commands** — `/next` (backlog ranking by impact+age−deps), `/rescue` (pipeline diagnosis), `/health` (hook health + config validation), `/brief` (display `.zie/handoff.md`), `/guide` (framework walkthrough)
- **Mechanical reviewer gate** — `reviewer-gate.py` PreToolUse:Write|Edit blocks direct `approved:true` writes; only `hooks/approve.py` can set approval status

### Fixed

- **Subagent context stale cache** — Added 2h TTL to session-context cache flag in `subagent-context.py`; prevents stale flags from persisting across re-runs
- **Sprint idle-gate** — Sprint scoring in NEW_INTENT_SIGNALS only fires when `active_task=none`; prevents spurious sprint hints mid-implementation

### Tests

- 2501 unit tests pass, 60 deselected
- 15 hooks tracked with error-path coverage gate (was 12)
- New test files: test_quality_gate.py, test_sprint_state.py, test_adaptive_learning.py, test_compact_hint_tiers.py

## v1.22.0 — 2026-04-06

### Features

- **zie-release-mode agent** — Fresh-context release executor (`make zie-release`) spawns `/release` in isolated agent, eliminating context overflow after long implementation sessions; provides 100% guarantee against "context limit reached" during release gate

### Fixed

- **Context token waste in sprint** — Sprint Phase 1 now passes `context_bundle` to plan-reviewer, eliminating redundant ADR+context.md reloads per review cycle (~3.2K tokens saved per 5-item sprint)
- **ADR-000-summary.md size** — Trimmed to 1559 words to pass test gate (was 1625); compressed decision titles to stay under 1600-word limit while preserving information density

### Changed

- **compact-hint hook upgraded** — Two-level context warnings: soft warn at 80%, hard warn at 90% directing to `make zie-release` or new session instead of `/compact`; guides users toward fresh context rather than compression

### Tests

- 2345 unit tests pass; 1 skipped
- New test: zie-release-mode agent invocation
- Updated test: compact-hint messaging (zie-release instead of /compact)

## v1.21.0 — 2026-04-06

### Features

- **Autonomous sprint mode** — New `autonomous_mode=true` flag enables fully unattended `/sprint` execution: clear backlog items, spec+plan all in parallel, implement sequentially, batch release, auto-run retro without user gates
- **Clarity-based spec workflow** — Backlog items scored for clarity (0–3 scale); items ≥2 write specs directly; items <2 ask one clarifying question before spec, reducing user interruptions in autonomous sprints
- **Inline reviewer architecture** — Replace async impl-reviewer Agent spawning with inline review inside `/implement` (HIGH risk only); spec-reviewer and plan-reviewer moved inline to `sprint.md` Phase 1 as Skill() calls; eliminates context overhead and background wait times
- **Auto-fix protocol for implementation** — Implementation issues found → fix inline → test → pass/continue or fail after 1 retry → interrupt user; replaces deferred polling with immediate resolution
- **Light retro mode** — `commands/retro.md` gates ADR writing on `<!-- adr: required -->` tag in shipped plan files; unmarked plans skip full ADR, update only `ADR-000-summary.md` with one-line entry; reduces retro overhead by ~80%
- **Sprint Phase 1 refactor** — Direct Skill() invocation chain (spec-design → write-plan → plan-reviewer inline) replaces intermediate Agent(general-purpose) spawn; reduces token overhead and wall-clock latency by ~40%
- **Sprint Phase 4 automation** — Auto-run `/retro` inline after batch release, no user prompt; sprint completes fully unattended

### Changed

- **Interrupt protocol formalized** — Only 3 cases interrupt user in autonomous mode: (1) vague backlog item (clarity <2 after question), (2) auto-fix failure after 1 retry, (3) dependency conflict detected; all other decisions auto-approved
- **ADR-000-summary.md compression** — Condensed 57 ADR table entries to fit word limit (1600 max); removed redundant titles from dense entries (Phase, Dimension, Dimensions, Architecture, etc.); supports growing ADR archive without re-compaction

### Tests

- 2345 unit tests pass; 1 test skipped (expected behavior)
- 8 new structural test files: autonomous mode, inline reviewers, light retro, clarity detection, interrupt protocol
- Integration tests verify phase headers and progress markers in audit.md, implement.md, sprint.md

## v1.20.0 — 2026-04-04

### Features

- **Pre-flight guard consolidation** — Canonical 3-step pre-flight protocol extracted to `zie-framework/project/command-conventions.md`; all 6 commands (spec, plan, fix, backlog, resync, implement) now reference one source of truth instead of duplicating inline
- **Init scan prompt extraction** — 400-word Explore agent prompt extracted from `commands/init.md` to `templates/init-scan-prompt.md`; init.md is 77 lines shorter; step 0 re-run guard and step 7 Makefile negotiation compressed to checklists

### Changed

- **Dead code removal** — `skills/reviewer-context/SKILL.md` deleted (never invoked after ADR-054 inlined context loading); PROJECT.md, README.md, and components.md updated
- **Prose cleanup** — 200-word reduction across `commands/sprint.md`, `commands/retro.md`, `commands/release.md`: explanatory restatements between phase headers and first imperative steps removed
- **Argument table replacement** — Python parse preambles removed from `commands/spec.md` and `commands/sprint.md`; replaced with `## Arguments` tables documenting flags and defaults

## v1.19.0 — 2026-04-04

### Features

- **Intent pattern matching expansion** — Detect `/hotfix`, `/chore`, `/spike` commands automatically via keyword patterns in user input (emergency, production issue, maintenance, throwaway exploration)
- **Framework Health section in /status** — New diagnostics block showing `safety_check_mode`, zie-memory status, playwright version, drift bypass count, and last 5 stop-failure log entries
- **Model right-sizing wave** — 10 model/effort optimizations: `/hotfix`, `/release`, `/retro`, `impl-reviewer`, `/resync`, `/init`, `/fix`, `/plan`, `write-plan`, `debug` skills downgraded from Opus/high to Sonnet/low or Haiku (40-50% cost savings)

### Changed

- **Lean refactoring cycle** — 15 codebase improvements: collapse sprint Phase 2 into Phase 1 inline retry, inline context bundle loading in all reviewer skills, move retro self-tuning to non-blocking advisory, suppress intent-sdlc injection for all slash commands, suppress idle-state status suffix when unambiguous intent detected, skip additionalContext when no test file found, remove knowledge-hash banner from /implement, deduplicate knowledge-hash in /status, early-exit subagent-context on idle, simplify /implement agent-mode gate to advisory, add test_output guard to verify check 2, extend intent patterns to all active commands, document SubagentStop matcher limitation, enhance XML/bidi injection escaping in safety-check-agent, add zie-memory guard to brain calls
- **Security hardening** — Escape opening XML tags and strip Unicode bidirectional overrides in safety-check-agent prompt injection shield; add > < | newline guards to confirm-wrap; quote subprocess slug argument in stop-guard
- **Dependency pinning strategy** — Standardize requirements-dev.txt to compatible-release (`~=X.Y.Z`) for all 6 packages, replacing inconsistent mix of `>=` and `==` pinning; enables Dependabot auto-merge for minor/patch bumps
- **Documentation sync** — README.md synced with current commands table (add `/chore`, `/hotfix`, `/spike`); skills table updated to reflect `load-context` and `reviewer-context`, remove stale `retro-format`

### Fixed

- **Plan reviewer performance** — Replace O(N²) pair-wise file conflict check with O(N) file→tasks map heuristic; now detects all conflicts in single linear scan
- **Code quality removals** — Remove redundant duplicate paragraph in write-plan skill (file conflict guidance stated twice); simplify notification-log by removing redundant inner type guard (outer guard + hooks.json matcher sufficient)
- **Command documentation** — Add triage rule to `/fix` and `/hotfix` descriptions (clarify when to use each); add `.gitignore` guidance to `/spike` for `spike-*/` directories; document CVE-2025-59288 derivation for Playwright version constant

### Tests

- 2294 unit tests pass; 1 test skipped (expected behavior); 45 items spec'd + plan'd + implement'd; full release gate verification (unit, integration, e2e, visual checks) — all gates pass
- 8 new structural test files added: docs pinning, skill dedup, status framework health, command triage rules

## v1.18.1 — 2026-04-04

### Changed

- **Consolidate reviewer disk fallback** — Compact Phase 1 blocks in spec-reviewer, plan-reviewer, impl-reviewer from verbose prose to delegation stubs with cache protocol alignment (ADR-048)
- **Fix release config triple read** — Bind .config once at pre-flight Step 2, remove redundant inline reads in Gates 3–4
- **Fix retro ROADMAP redundant reads** — Thread roadmap_raw binding through Done-write and Done-rotation sections (eliminate 2 re-reads)
- **Align load-context ADR cache protocol** — Prepend get_cached_adrs cache-check Step 0 before disk reads (align with reviewer-context protocol)
- **Fix sprint ROADMAP phase rebind** — Bind roadmap_post_phase1 and roadmap_post_phase2, eliminate Phase 3 ROADMAP re-read

### Fixed

- **Framework efficiency** — Eliminate ~7 redundant file reads across release, retro, sprint orchestration and skill chaining
- **Multiple unnecessary test runs** — Added "Run tests once per phase" rule to tdd-loop and implement commands (never re-run for different grep filters)

### Tests

- 2175 unit tests + 59 integration tests (5 optimization items verified, all gates pass)

## v1.18.0 — 2026-04-04

### Features

- **UX output formatting** — Colorized progress output with Thai phase names, handoff blocks for sequential workflows, structured `[zie-framework] key: value` format for INFO-level hook output
- **Workflow enforcement** — Drift log (`zie-framework/.drift-log`) tracks SDLC bypass events; `is_track_active()` guard prevents implement/fix without active backlog→spec→plan track; escape hatches: `/hotfix`, `/spike`, `/chore` for non-standard workflows
- **Escape hatch commands** — New `/hotfix` (minimal drift fix, no spec), `/spike` (sandbox exploration, no ROADMAP write), `/chore` (direct Done entry, no spec/plan)
- **Smarter backlog intelligence** — Auto-tag backlog items via keyword map (infer_tag), duplicate detection on slug ≥2-token overlap (find_duplicate_slugs)
- **Proactive performance nudges** — Stop hook now detects: RED cycles >3 days → auto-adjust `auto_test_max_wait_s`, no recent BLOCKs → suggest `safety_check_mode: "regex"`, backlog items >90d old → prompt review
- **Retro self-tuning** — Parse RED cycle durations from drift log; build_tuning_proposals() surfaces up to 3 config adjustments with rationale
- **ROADMAP itemized dates** — `parse_roadmap_items_with_dates()` extracts dates and clean titles from Done section; powers stale-item nudges

### Changed

- **command namespace flattened** — All `commands/zie-*.md` → `commands/*.md` (e.g., `zie-backlog.md` → `backlog.md`); invocation surface: `zie-framework:backlog` instead of `zie-framework:zie-backlog` — reduces naming friction for CLI flows
- **hook naming updates** — All hook output, ROADMAP links, agent suggestions updated to `/backlog`, `/spec`, `/plan`, `/implement` (no zie- prefix) — 500+ line updates across 60 files
- **skill names aligned** — Skill invocations in commands/agents use flattened names (e.g., `Skill(zie-framework:tdd-loop)` unchanged; but skill delivery tests updated for new file paths)
- **status command expanded** — Added drift count row to status table: `Drift | N bypass events (zie-framework/.drift-log)`

### Fixed

- **intent-sdlc pipeline gate logic** — Removed old implement gate blocking empty Now; replaced with no-track check for implement/fix (shows escape-hatch options instead of hard block)
- **test suite namespace migration** — 46 test files updated: command filename refs (`zie-backlog.md`→`backlog.md`), content assertions (`/zie-spec`→`/spec`), quoted string patterns (`"zie-*.md"`→`"*.md"`)
- **stop-guard nudge delivery** — Non-git-repo detection no longer silently exits; nudges now fire for all valid projects with .config present

## v1.17.0 — 2026-04-04

### Features

- **load-context skill** — New `skills/load-context/SKILL.md` shared skill consolidates ADR + project context bundle load; replaces 3 inline duplicates in `zie-plan`, `zie-implement`, `zie-sprint`
- **reviewer-context skill** — New `skills/reviewer-context/SKILL.md` extracts identical Phase 1 protocol from spec-reviewer, plan-reviewer, and impl-reviewer — single source of truth for cache-first ADR loading
- **subagent-context Explore guard** — Explore agents no longer read plan files (no active task mid-spec); Plan agents retain full `Task:` field — reduces wasted I/O per subagent spawn
- **safety-check Haiku model** — `safety_check_agent.py` routes to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for binary ALLOW/BLOCK classification — ~80% cost reduction per Bash call
- **safety-check XML injection guard** — Shell command wrapped in `<command>...</command>` XML delimiters in subagent prompt — prevents prompt injection via crafted Bash commands
- **roadmap cache mtime-gate** — `utils_roadmap.py` ROADMAP cache now invalidates on file modification time change instead of 30s TTL — more accurate, zero false hits

### Changed

- **strip static additionalContext** — Removed boilerplate strings from `failure-context.py`, `sdlc-compact.py`, `subagent-context.py` per-event payloads; moved to `CLAUDE.md` Hook Context Hints section
- **session-resume fire-and-forget** — `session-resume.py` knowledge drift check now uses `subprocess.Popen` (non-blocking) instead of `subprocess.run` — off SessionStart critical path
- **retro inline ADR writes** — `/zie-retro` writes ADRs and updates ROADMAP inline (Write/Edit tools) instead of spawning background agents — eliminates 2 subagent spawns per retro
- **docs-sync consolidation** — `/zie-retro` and `/zie-release` both delegate docs sync to `Skill(zie-framework:docs-sync-check)` — removes 3 inline implementations
- **sprint Phase 1 skill chain** — `/zie-sprint` Phase 1 invokes spec-design → spec-reviewer → write-plan → plan-reviewer skill chain directly instead of `--draft-plan` flag
- **wip-checkpoint counter fix** — Counter file written before modulo check so count persists across subprocess invocations — checkpoint every 5 edits now works correctly
- **write-plan reviewer removed** — `skills/write-plan/SKILL.md` no longer invokes plan-reviewer loop (reviewer gate belongs in `zie-plan.md`) — removes duplicate reviewer invocation
- **zie-implement agent warn** — Outside agent session: warn-only print instead of interactive confirm/cancel — non-blocking for script use
- **zie-status velocity** — Single `git log --tags --simplify-by-decoration` call replaces sequential `git tag` loop — O(1) velocity computation

### Fixed

- **wip-checkpoint modulo** — Fixed counter never reaching 5 (write was after modulo check; each subprocess started fresh from 0)
- **stop-guard session isolation** — Unique `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` per test run prevents cache leaking between parallel tests
- **retro-format skill deleted** — Removed deprecated `skills/retro-format/SKILL.md` (~140 lines dead code)
- **pin pytest CVE-2025-71176** — `requirements-dev.txt` now pins `pytest>=9.0.3`
- **zie-plan Notes section** — Removed redundant Notes section (~6 lines)
- **task-gate suppress advisory** — Task-completed-gate exits silently (empty stdout) for docs/config tasks instead of printing advisory

## v1.16.3 — 2026-04-04

### Features

- **proactive-compact-hint** — New Stop hook warns when context usage ≥80% (configurable via `compact_hint_threshold` in .config); prints informational hint to encourage `/compact` before continuing
- **audit-mcp-check** — `/zie-audit` Agent 2 now detects unused MCP servers configured in settings.json but never referenced in commands/skills — reports LOW findings to reduce context overhead
- **roadmap-done-rotation** — `/zie-retro` now auto-archives Done items >90 days old to `archive/ROADMAP-archive-YYYY-MM.md` (append-only); keeps 10 most-recent items inline for history
- **implement-skill-dedup** — `/zie-implement` task loop now uses `Skill(zie-framework:tdd-loop)` pointer instead of inline RED/GREEN/REFACTOR prose — reduces duplication, improves maintainability

### Changed

- **sprint-agent-audit** — `/zie-sprint` Phase 3 (IMPLEMENT) replaces Agent spawning with direct Skill invocation for sequential execution — improves clarity, reduces token overhead
- **split-utils-py** — Refactored 737-line `hooks/utils.py` into 5 focused sub-modules: `utils_config`, `utils_safety`, `utils_event`, `utils_io`, `utils_roadmap` — each hook imports only what it needs, improves discoverability and maintainability
- **merge-safety-hooks** — Consolidated `safety-check.py` and `input-sanitizer.py` into single PreToolUse entry in hooks.json — reduces subprocess spawns from 3→2 per Bash call
- **zie-init delegation** — Step 2 (scan + knowledge drift) delegated to Agent(Explore) with JSON output → reduces command size by ~100 lines
- **retro inlining** — `/zie-retro` now does format + docs-sync checks inline (Bash) instead of spawning agents — keeps ADR + ROADMAP agents for file writes only
- **release gate inlining** — `/zie-release` replaces 4 Agent spawns (test-int, test-e2e, lint, visual) with inline parallel Bash execution — saves ~40k tokens per release
- **intent-sdlc early-exit** — `intent-sdlc.py` now exits early when message is clearly non-SDLC (length <5, no SDLC keywords) — reduces processing overhead on casual messages

### Fixed

- **auto-test output truncation** — `auto-test.py` now truncates test output injection to pass/fail summary + first failure block; skips truncation for .md and config files — improves context efficiency
- **rm -rf pattern false positive** — BLOCKS pattern now uses negative lookahead to distinguish `rm -rf ./` (bare dot, blocked) from `rm -rf ./subdir/` (confirm-wrapped) — fixes over-aggressive blocking

## v1.16.2 — 2026-04-03

### Changed

- **ROADMAP backlog refresh** — Added 12 next-priority items (6 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM,
  2 LOW) for optimization: auto-test output truncation, intent-sdlc early exit,
  release gate inlining, retro format inlining, zie-init delegation, hook
  consolidation, utils modularization, sprint audit, skill dedup, MCP audit,
  proactive compaction
- **Pre-commit hook refactor** — Simplified pre-commit from 45 lines to 2-line
  stub; version drift, bandit SAST, markdownlint checks moved to CI pipeline

## v1.16.1 — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Qwen3-coder-next compatibility** — Fixed `async: true` hooks (hooks.json) → `background: true` for session-learn.py, session-cleanup.py, subagent-stop.py
- **safety_check_agent.py CLI fallback** — Moved `claude` CLI check to `evaluate()` entry point for graceful regex fallback when CLI unavailable
- **test_test_ci skipping** — Skip test when sitecustomize.py unavailable (subprocess hook coverage not available)

### Changed
- **hooks.json protocol** — Replaced `async` with `background` for all Stop hooks
- **Test suite** — Updated `test_architecture_cleanup.py` to check `background` instead of `async`

## v1.16.0 — 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Hook timing instrumentation** — Added `log_hook_timing()` utility and structured session execution logs (`/tmp/zie-{session_id}/timing.log`) to track hook performance and diagnose slow paths
- **Environment file permissions** — CLAUDE_ENV_FILE written by `session-resume.py` now set to mode 0o600 (restrictive) per security hardening guidelines
- **Input validation hardening** — Extended dangerous compound regex in `input-sanitizer.py` to guard bare braces (`{` / `}`) alongside existing metachar guards
- **Test boundary case coverage** — Added 6 edge case tests for ADR summary extraction (pipe escaping, truncation at max length, multi-sentence truncation)
- **Weak test assertions** — Replaced ~335 weak keyword-presence checks with structural assertions (section ordering, header presence, frontmatter properties)
- **Safety agent command length** — Added MAX_CMD_CHARS (4096) truncation with marker in `safety_check_agent.py` to prevent oversized prompts
- **Coverage measurement fix** — Adjusted coverage gate from 55% to 48% (ADR-037 updated); documents environmental constraint (sitecustomize.py unavailability in venv)

### Changed
- **Pytest marker consolidation** — Moved `error_path` marker definition from `conftest.py` to `pytest.ini` per pytest best practices
- **Dead code removal** — Removed artifact `if __name__ == "__main__": pass` block from `intent-sdlc.py`
- **Documentation fix** — Corrected doubled "project/project/" path component in README.md directory structure display

## v1.15.0 — 2026-04-01

### Features
- **zie-sprint** — Batch backlog processor for phase-parallel execution: all items through spec/plan together (parallel), then implement (sequential WIP=1), batch release (single tag), single retro. Reduces N releases→1, N retros→1, context loads~25N→1
- **sprint intent detection** — Added 8 patterns to `intent-sdlc.py` for detecting sprint intent from natural language ("sprint", "clear backlog", "ship all", etc.)

## v1.14.2 — 2026-03-30

### Changed
- `make test-fast` no longer runs the full suite when no files have changed — uses `--lfnf=none` so it exits in <1s instead of 2+ minutes
- `make test-fast` fallback (unmapped .py files) now runs raw `pytest tests/unit/` without coverage overhead, instead of `make test-unit`

## v1.14.1 — 2026-03-30

### Changed
- Release Gate 1 now uses `make test-fast` — after a clean implement commit, runs ~0 tests instead of the full suite (~90s → ~1s)
- Word count limits standardized to 1000 across zie-implement/release/retro — eliminates per-file threshold management
- `/zie-implement` passes captured test output to `verify` skill — eliminates the third consecutive `make test-unit` run at end of implement
- `zie-retro` skips docs-sync agent when called immediately after `/zie-release` (already ran during release)
- `zie-retro` pre-loads ROADMAP Next lane in pre-flight — removes second ROADMAP read in "Suggest next"
- `make test-fast` no longer prints `mapfile: command not found` warnings on macOS (bash 3.2 compatibility)

## v1.14.0 — 2026-03-30

### Features
- **agentic-pipeline-v2** — Removed human confirmation gates from spec/plan/retro/release flows; auto-approve when reviewers pass, with override options
- **context-lean-sprint** — ADR session caching (`write_adr_cache`/`get_cached_adrs`) + shared_context bundle in `zie-audit` eliminates redundant reads across agents
- **parallel-release-gates** — Gates 2–4 now spawn simultaneously after Gate 1 passes; docs-sync runs before Gate 1; all failures collected before stopping
- **model-routing-v2** — `zie-release` and `impl-reviewer` use `haiku` with inline `<!-- model: sonnet -->` escalation annotations for judgment-heavy steps
- **workflow-lean** — `--focus` flag for `zie-audit`, `--draft-plan` for `zie-spec`, section-targeted revision loop in `zie-init`
- **dx-polish** — Pipeline stage indicator in `zie-status`, max-iterations next-steps blocks in reviewers, task sizing guidance (S/M/L) in `write-plan`

### Changed
- `zie-retro` and `zie-release` use `general-purpose` agent instead of plugin-specific agents (no plugin reload required)
- `zie-implement` shows agent mode warning when run outside `--agent zie-framework:zie-implement-mode`

## v1.13.0 — 2026-03-30

### Features
- **zie-audit v2** — upgraded from 3 to 7 audit dimensions: Security, Code Health,
  Performance, Structural, Dependency Health, Observability, and a new dedicated
  External Research agent that searches for stack/domain-specific improvements
  (not just bugs). Phase 3 synthesis is now inline (saves 1 agent call). Phase 4
  uses batch backlog prompts (all/select/skip) instead of one-by-one. Scoring
  now categorizes findings as Quick Win, Strategic, or Defer.

### Fixed / Changed
- **5 portability fixes** for using zie-framework in other repos: missing
  `retro-format` and `docs-sync-check` agents now registered; `zie-init` creates
  `dev` branch automatically (required by `make release`); `zie-init` creates
  `.markdownlintignore` so generated SDLC files don't fail pre-commit lint;
  safety hook now allows `git push origin main --tags` (used by `make release`);
  Makefile.local template uses `PYTHON ?= .venv/bin/python3` to avoid
  system/Homebrew version mismatches
- **Plugin marketplace decoupled** — zie-framework and zie-memory no longer
  cross-update each other on release. Each plugin self-contained via
  `github:zierocode/zie-framework` in settings.json. `make release` creates a
  GitHub release directly without touching other repos.

## v1.12.0 — 2026-03-30

### Features

- **Pipeline gate enforcement** — hooks now enforce spec-first ordering:
  PreToolUse blocks `/zie-plan` without an approved spec, and `/zie-implement`
  without an approved plan. Prevents workflow shortcuts.
- **ADR session cache** — mtime-keyed cache in `utils.py` eliminates redundant
  ADR file loads across reviewer calls in the same session.
- **ADR auto-summarization** — `/zie-retro` now generates `ADR-000-summary.md`
  when ADR count exceeds 30, keeping context windows manageable.
- **User onboarding orientation** — `SessionStart` hook warns on knowledge drift;
  `/zie-init` prints SDLC pipeline summary on first run.
- **make test-fast / make test-ci** — two-tier test suite: fast dev loop
  (changed files + last-failed) vs full suite with coverage gate.
- **Hook resilience tests** — error-path coverage for all 10 production hooks;
  new `check_error_path_coverage.py` enforces ≥1 error-path test per hook.
- **ROADMAP Done compaction** — `compact_roadmap_done()` in utils auto-archives
  Done entries older than 6 months when count exceeds 20 (runs in `/zie-retro`).
- **Hook config hardening** — `validate_config()` + `CONFIG_SCHEMA` give typed
  defaults for all 4 timeout keys; auto-test gains wall-clock kill guard.
- **CONFIG_DEFAULTS centralization** — single source of truth for all 7 config
  keys; no more inline `config.get("key", default)` scattered across hooks.
- **zie-init single-pass scan** — Explore agent now returns `migratable_docs`
  as part of its report; step 2h reads from agent output instead of rescanning.
- **make archive-prune** — 90-day TTL rotation for `zie-framework/archive/`;
  guard skips pruning on projects with fewer than 20 archived files; integrated
  into `/zie-retro` post-release cleanup.
- **make clean coverage artifacts** — `.coverage`, `coverage.xml`, `htmlcov/`
  now removed by `make clean`.

### Fixed / Changed

- Retro no longer double-reads ROADMAP; release docs-sync fallback is now
  non-blocking (graceful degradation instead of hard stop).
- Coverage gate lowered from 50% to 43% to reflect actual measurable coverage
  without subprocess hook instrumentation (`coverage sitecustomize` removed in
  coverage 7.x).

## v1.11.1 — 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Git subprocess calls in `failure-context.py` and `sdlc-compact.py` now read from
  a session-scoped file cache before spawning a process — reduces redundant git calls
  on hot paths during active editing sessions.
- Test assertions across 5 hook test files now verify observable side-effects
  (stdout content, file existence, counter values) rather than just exit code — catches
  regressions that previously would have silently passed.

### Docs
- `safety_check_mode` config key is now documented in `CLAUDE.md` with all three
  valid values (`"regex"`, `"agent"`, `"both"`) and their tradeoffs.

## v1.11.0 — 2026-03-27

### Features

- **Archive strategy** — `make archive` moves shipped SDLC artifacts (backlog/specs/plans)
  to `zie-framework/archive/` after release; `/zie-release` now includes archive step;
  keeps active directories lean; idempotent (ADR-023)
- **`/zie-implement` pre-flight guard** — stops execution when ROADMAP.md is missing,
  WIP task is active in Now lane, or Ready lane has no approved plan; guides user to
  correct next command
- **`parse_roadmap_ready()`** — new utility in `hooks/utils.py` mirroring
  `parse_roadmap_now()` for extracting the Ready lane
- **Parallel ADR + ROADMAP update in `/zie-retro`** — ADR write and ROADMAP update
  now launched as concurrent background Agents; failure mode documented

### Changed

- **Effort routing** — `write-plan` SKILL.md downgraded from `effort: high` to `effort: medium`;
  `effort: high` reserved exclusively for `spec-design` (ADR-022)
- **CI hardening** — `make test` → `make test-unit` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`;
  integration tests require a live Claude session and are excluded from CI
- **Token trim** — redundant intro paragraphs removed from `/zie-implement`, `/zie-release`,
  `/zie-retro`; verbose ASCII table example in retro replaced with compact inline format
- **Security** — `sdlc-permissions.py` metachar guard blocks `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `` ` ``,
  `$(` before allowlist check; atomic write helpers enforce 0o600 permissions;
  `is_zie_initialized()` uses `.is_dir()` not `.exists()` to reject symlink files
- **Dead code removal** — `idle_prompt` Notification handler + hooks.json matcher removed;
  `exec_module` replaced with `SourceFileLoader` pattern in test fixtures

## v1.10.0 — 2026-03-27

### Features

- **Lean & Efficient Optimization** — reduce session token overhead ~47%:
  merged `intent-detect.py` + `sdlc-context.py` into single `intent-sdlc.py`
  hook; added 30s ROADMAP.md session cache; `wip-checkpoint` now runs async
  (background: true); `safety_check_mode` defaults to `regex` (no subagent
  on every tool call); `zie-audit` migrated from 5 Opus agents to 3 Sonnet
  agents + synthesis pass (effort: high → medium, per ADR-021); `zie-retro`
  effort: high → medium; `zie-implement` slimmed 351 → 109 lines; parallel
  agent caps removed from `zie-implement` and `zie-plan` — `depends_on` and
  file-conflict detection govern serialization instead; `make archive-plans`
  target added for plans/ housekeeping
- **Hybrid Release** — generic base `Makefile` + `Makefile.local` hook
  architecture; project-specific publish steps live in `Makefile.local`,
  keeping the framework Makefile shareable across projects
- **Single Zierocode Marketplace** — `ZIEROCODE_MKT` sync added to release
  pipeline; one command now publishes to the marketplace

## v1.9.0 — 2026-03-25

### Features

- **hook-events JSON schema** (`hooks/hook-events.schema.json`): formal JSON
  Schema for the Claude Code hook event envelope — documents `tool_name`,
  `tool_input`, `tool_response`, `is_interrupt`, `session_id` fields with types
- **SDLC_STAGES canonical list** in `utils.py`: single source of truth for
  stage names used by `intent-detect` and `sdlc-context`
- **`normalize_command()` utility**: deduped whitespace-normalization used by
  `safety-check`, `safety_check_agent`, and `sdlc-permissions` — no more
  inline `re.sub` copies
- **Configurable TEST_INDICATORS** in `task-completed-gate`: project can set
  `test_indicators` in `.config` to override which file patterns are considered
  test files (e.g. `.spec.`, `.test.`, `_test.`)
- **Async Stop hooks**: `session-learn.py` and `session-cleanup.py` now run
  with `"async": true` — session end no longer blocks on slow network calls

### Fixed

- **`load_config()` now parses JSON** (was silently broken — `.config` is
  JSON but old code used a KEY=VALUE parser, so `safety_check_mode` was never
  read from config)
- **Shell injection in `input-sanitizer.py`**: restricted allowed characters
  in path rewrite to prevent injected shell metacharacters
- **`/tmp` hardening**: atomic write-then-rename for all tmp files, O_EXCL
  creation, mode `0o600` — eliminates TOCTOU race and predictable-name attacks
- **Path traversal**: replaced `startswith()` with `is_relative_to()` in
  `input-sanitizer.py` — prevents `../` escape from cwd
- **Subprocess timeouts on git calls** in `sdlc-compact.py`: all `git` calls
  now have `timeout=5` to prevent hooks hanging indefinitely
- **Coverage measurement**: `.coveragerc` added; `make test-unit` now correctly
  measures subprocess coverage via `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START`
- **`BLOCKS`/`WARNS` moved to `utils.py`**: `safety_check_agent` no longer
  needs an `importlib` workaround — imports directly; 39-line reduction
- **`safe_project_name()` in `notification-log`**: consistent with all other
  hooks that sanitize project name for use in tmp file paths
- **Log prefix audit**: all deprecated `[zie] warning:` prefixes replaced
  with `[zie-framework] <hook-name>:` across all hooks

### Changed

- `make test-unit` comment clarified to explicitly say "excludes integration tests"
- CLAUDE.md Optional Dependencies table added (pytest, coverage, playwright, zie-memory)
- README.md Skills section added (11 skills documented)
- architecture.md version history updated through v1.9.0

## v1.8.0 — 2026-03-24

### Features

- **docs-sync-check skill**: new `haiku + context:fork` skill that verifies
  `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` match actual commands/skills/hooks on disk;
  returns structured JSON verdict for callers to act on
- **Parallel quality gates in `/zie-release`**: TODOs/secrets scan and
  docs-sync-check fork immediately after Gate 1 passes, running concurrently
  with Gate 2/3 (integration + e2e) — serial gate count drops from 7 to 5
- **Verify overlap in `/zie-implement`**: `verify` is now forked with captured
  test output immediately after the final `make test-unit`, running in parallel
  with ROADMAP update and `git add` prep — eliminates a full test re-run
- **Parallel forks in `/zie-retro`**: `retro-format` and `docs-sync-check` are
  forked simultaneously while the parent writes ADRs, then results are collected

### Changed

- **impl-reviewer upgraded**: `model: haiku, effort: low` → `model: sonnet,
  effort: medium` — code review is reasoning-heavy; fork already bounds context
  to the changed-files bundle so cost increase is well-bounded
- **verify and retro-format get `context: fork`**: both skills now declare
  `context: fork` with documented `$ARGUMENTS` input format; fall back to
  full inline mode when called without arguments (backward compatible)
- **zie-spec and zie-plan effort lowered**: `effort: high` → `effort: medium`
  — heavy reasoning is delegated to spec-design/write-plan skills; these
  commands are orchestration-only
- **Unofficial `type:` fields removed**: `tdd-loop` (`type: process`),
  `test-pyramid` (`type: reference`), and `retro-format` (`type: reference`)
  — these were non-standard fields not in the Claude Code spec; tests now
  enforce their absence

## v1.7.0 — 2026-03-24

### Features

- **Pipeline speed**: implement loop now inlines guidance and parallelizes
  independent tasks by default — no more per-task skill round-trips
- **Lazy plan loading**: task detail is read only when that task starts,
  cutting context overhead for large plans
- **Terse reviewer output**: approved results in 1 line; issue reports use
  bullets only — no narrative prose
- **Reviewer shared context**: ADRs + context.md loaded once per session,
  not re-read per review pass
- **Reviewer fail-fast**: all issues surfaced in a single pass (max 2 iterations)
- **Risk-based impl-reviewer**: low-risk tasks skip the reviewer gate entirely
- **spec-design fast path**: complete backlog items skip clarifying questions
- **spec-design batch approval**: all spec sections written at once, single review
- **verify scoped mode**: `scope=tests-only` for bug-fix path skips full lint
- **Skill content pruning**: tutorial prose and examples removed from all 10 skills
- **Velocity tracking**: `/zie-status` now shows release throughput from git tags
- **Retro → next loop**: retrospective surfaces top backlog candidate to act on next
- **Retro living docs sync**: retro systematically diffs and updates CLAUDE.md + README.md
- **Session-resume compression**: hook output compressed from 20+ lines to 4 lines
- **Audit hard data**: Phase 1 now collects pytest coverage, radon complexity,
  and pip audit CVE counts before research begins
- **Audit historical diff**: each audit diffs scores against the previous run
- **Audit parallel research**: all Phase 3 WebSearch queries dispatched in a
  single parallel batch instead of a sequential loop
- **Audit auto-fix offer**: low/medium findings trigger a scoped `/zie-fix` offer
- **GitHub Actions CI**: pytest runs automatically on push/PR to main and dev
- **pre-commit markdownlint gate**: `markdownlint-cli2` runs on every commit
- **`make bump`**: atomically bumps VERSION + plugin.json with semver validation
- **Version consistency gate**: `/zie-release` blocks if VERSION and plugin.json
  are out of sync before any tests run
- **63 integration tests**: every hook script tested as a subprocess with a
  realistic Claude Code event payload on stdin

### Fixed

- Hook tests were inheriting session-injected env vars (`ZIE_AUTO_TEST_DEBOUNCE_MS`,
  `ZIE_MEMORY_ENABLED`, `ZIE_TEST_RUNNER`) from the outer Claude Code process,
  causing 9 pre-existing test failures — all test `run_hook()` helpers now
  clear these vars so hooks read from config
- `auto-test.py` debounce guard now correctly treats `debounce_ms=0` as
  "no debounce" (was susceptible to filesystem clock rounding on APFS)

## v1.6.0 — 2026-03-24

### Features

- **Session-wide agent modes** — `zie-implement-mode` (permissionMode: acceptEdits,
  all tools) and `zie-audit-mode` (permissionMode: plan, read-only) agents for
  one-command session setup with SDLC context pre-loaded
- **Plugin MCP bundle** — `.claude-plugin/.mcp.json` auto-registers the zie-memory
  MCP server at plugin load time; brain integration now requires zero per-project setup
- **Agent isolation** — reviewer agents gain `isolation: worktree` (clean committed
  snapshot) and `background: true` (async spawn with deferred-check polling pattern)
- **Notification hook** — logs `permission_prompt` and `idle_prompt` events; injects
  `additionalContext` after 3+ repeated permission requests to help Claude self-unblock
- **ConfigChange drift detection** — detects CLAUDE.md, settings.json, and
  zie-framework/.config changes at session start; warns on config drift
- **Safety check agent type** — `type: "agent"` hook mode with A/B testing support
  via `safety_check_mode` config flag (regex / agent / both)
- **TaskCompleted quality gate** — blocks task completion on failing tests; warns on
  uncommitted files when a task is marked done
- **StopFailure hook** — captures API errors and rate-limit notifications to a
  per-project tmp file for post-session review
- **Plugin settings.json + CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA** — persistent storage path for
  plugin-level data; plugin ships reference `settings.json` with defaults
- **PreCompact/PostCompact WIP preservation** — saves active WIP context before
  context compaction and restores it immediately after
- **UserPromptSubmit SDLC context** — injects current feature name and active plan
  into every user prompt turn
- **SubagentStart SDLC context** — injects zie-framework pipeline context into every
  Explore and Plan subagent spawn
- **SubagentStop lifecycle hooks** — captures subagent completion with ID; enables
  resume-by-ID pattern for follow-up questions in the same session
- **SessionStart env file** — reads `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` at session start for config
  injection and env var fast-paths
- **PermissionRequest auto-approve** — automatically approves safe SDLC Bash
  operations (make test-unit, git status, etc.) without interrupting Claude
- **PostToolUse test file hints** — emits `additionalContext` with the matching test
  file path on every source file save
- **PostToolUseFailure debug context** — injects SDLC debug context into the next
  turn when a tool fails, surfacing likely root causes
- **PreToolUse input sanitizer** — resolves relative paths to absolute; rewrites
  dangerous Bash patterns to require confirmation
- **Stop hook uncommitted guard** — warns before session end when uncommitted
  implementation files are detected
- **Skills context:fork** — spec-reviewer, plan-reviewer, and impl-reviewer now run
  in isolated fork context, preventing reviewer contamination of main context
- **Skills bash injection** — `` !`cmd` `` syntax in skill content injects live shell
  output at invocation time (git log, git status, knowledge hash)
- **Skills frontmatter hardening** — all skills gain `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`,
  and `effort` fields; Claude Code enforces tool restrictions at runtime
- **Reviewer agents with persistent memory** — reviewer skills converted to custom
  agent definitions with `isolation: worktree` / `background: true` frontmatter
- **Skills advanced features** — `$ARGUMENTS[N]` indexed argument access; zie-audit
  promoted to first-class skill with `reference.md` supporting file

### Changed

- **Full model+effort routing** — all 22 commands and skills now have explicit
  `model` and `effort` frontmatter: `opus` for zie-audit (9-dim analysis),
  `sonnet` for design/build/release, `haiku` for mechanical/checklist tasks
- **MCP canonical tool names** — all zie-memory calls in commands and skills updated
  to canonical `mcp__plugin_zie-memory_zie-memory__*` tool names
- **1101 unit tests** — up from 400 in v1.5.0; full coverage across all new hooks,
  skills, agents, and frontmatter contracts

## v1.5.0 — 2026-03-24

### Security

- **Whitespace normalization** — `safety-check.py` now strips and collapses
  whitespace before pattern matching, closing a bypass where `rm  -rf  /`
  (multi-space) was not caught by the block rules.
- **Symlink attack prevention** — `safe_write_tmp()` in `utils.py` now
  detects symlinks on the target path and refuses to write, blocking an
  attack where a symlink to a sensitive file could be overwritten via
  hook state files.
- **TOCTOU race fix** — debounce file writes (auto-test, wip-checkpoint)
  now use atomic write-then-rename instead of direct `write_text()`,
  eliminating a race condition in concurrent hook invocations.
- **CWD boundary enforcement** — `auto-test.py` resolves and validates
  `file_path` against the project CWD before use; paths outside the
  project are silently ignored.
- **intent-detect ReDoS guard** — Added `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN = 500` cap
  before regex matching; long messages exit early before pattern evaluation.

### Features

- **Bandit SAST** — `make lint` now runs `bandit -r hooks/ -ll` and the
  pre-commit hook gates every commit on bandit passing.
- **Dependabot** — `.github/dependabot.yml` added for automated pip and
  GitHub Actions dependency updates.
- **Signed releases** — `make release` now uses `git tag -s` (GPG-signed
  tags) with clean-tree and branch pre-flight guards.
- **SLSA L1 provenance** — `.github/workflows/release-provenance.yml`
  generates attestations on every tagged release via
  `actions/attest-build-provenance@v1`.

### Changed

- **Shared hook utilities** — `hooks/utils.py` gained `read_event()`,
  `get_cwd()`, `parse_roadmap_section()`, and `call_zie_memory_api()`.
  All 7 hooks now use these helpers; 200+ lines of duplicated boilerplate
  removed across the codebase.
- **`hooks/knowledge-hash.py`** — Knowledge hash computation extracted
  from inline `python3 -c "..."` blocks in `zie-init.md`, `zie-status.md`,
  and `zie-resync.md` into a standalone script.
- **SECURITY.md** — Added fork note to advisory URL and new `## Release
  Signing` section documenting GPG tag verification and SLSA provenance.

### Tests

- 400 unit tests (was 361) — added contract tests for counter ValueError
  recovery, safety-check ReDoS performance bounds, `find_matching_test()`
  edge cases (missing dir, symlinks, permission-denied, empty dir), and
  comprehensive coverage for all new hook utilities.

## v1.4.1 — 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **Safety hooks** — PreToolUse `exit(2)` was silently ineffective (was
  `exit(1)`). All 9 block patterns now correctly trigger Claude Code's block
  signal. `rm -rf ./`, force-push to main, `--no-verify`, DROP DATABASE etc.
  are now actually blocked, not just logged.
- **Hook URL validation** — `session-learn.py` and `wip-checkpoint.py` had
  a hardcoded `https://memory.zie-agent.cloud` fallback. Replaced with an
  empty default + `if not api_url.startswith("https://")` guard so hooks
  never silently call an unexpected endpoint.
- **intent-detect** — Prompt that starts with `/zie-*` command text was not
  being skipped; also now skips YAML frontmatter (starts with `---`) and
  messages longer than 500 chars to avoid false-positive intent suggestions.

### Changed

- **`hooks/utils.py`** — New shared library with `parse_roadmap_now()` and
  `project_tmp_path()`. All hooks that read ROADMAP or write to `/tmp` now
  use these helpers — eliminates 40+ lines of duplicated inline logic and
  prevents cross-project `/tmp` file collisions when multiple projects use
  the framework simultaneously.
- **`hooks/session-cleanup.py`** — New Stop hook that deletes project-scoped
  `/tmp` files at session end, so stale debounce/counter state from one
  session never bleeds into the next.
- **Pattern pre-compilation** — `intent-detect.py` now compiles all regex
  patterns once at module load (`COMPILED_PATTERNS`) instead of recompiling
  on every keystroke, improving runtime safety and performance.
- **Silent exception logging** — All `except Exception: pass` swallowed
  errors in hooks now log to stderr for visibility without breaking hook
  safety contract.
- **Hook output protocol** — `hooks/hooks.json` now documents the expected
  stdout format for each event type via `_hook_output_protocol` key.

### Tests

- **290 unit tests** (was 258 pre-sprint). New coverage:
  - `test_utils.py` — `parse_roadmap_now` + `project_tmp_path` (11 tests)
  - `test_session_cleanup.py` — Stop hook file cleanup (5 tests)
  - `test_docs_standards.py` — plugin.json sync, ADR numbering, SECURITY.md,
    .cz.toml, README references, CHANGELOG translation (21 tests)
  - Autouse `/tmp` teardown fixtures across all hook test classes
  - `TestIntentDetectHappyPath` assertions upgraded to JSON parse
  - `TestFindMatchingTest` — `find_matching_test()` importable + direct tests
  - `TestAutoTestDebounceBoundary` + `TestWipCheckpointRoadmapEdgeCases`

### Docs

- `SECURITY.md` — added vulnerability reporting and responsible disclosure
  policy (90-day embargo).
- `.cz.toml` — commitizen config for conventional commits with 9 commit types.
- `project/context.md` — ADR headers canonicalized from `D-NNN` to `ADR-NNN`.
- `project/architecture.md` — updated timestamp and added Version History
  Summary section.
- `CHANGELOG.md v1.1.0` — translated from Thai to English.
- `Makefile` — added `sync-version` target; `.githooks/pre-commit` now checks
  version drift before markdownlint.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-03-23

### Features

- **/zie-audit** — New 5-phase project health command. Builds a
  `research_profile` from your codebase, runs 5 parallel agents across
  9 dimensions (Security, Lean, Quality, Docs, Architecture + Performance,
  Dependency Health, Developer Experience, Standards), fetches external
  benchmarks via WebSearch/WebFetch, scores each dimension /100, and
  presents a ranked findings report. You select which findings to push
  into backlog + ROADMAP. Supports `--focus <dim>` for scoped audits.

### Fixed

- **/zie-implement** — Removed stale `/zie-plan "idea"` reference (now
  correctly points to `/zie-spec`). Added explicit commit step after all
  tasks complete so feature code lands on `dev` before release.
- **/zie-release** — Replaced double-verify pattern with inline TODO +
  secrets scan to eliminate redundant verify call at release time.
- **Makefile** — `make release` now folds plugin.json version bump into
  the release commit via `--amend` instead of creating a separate commit.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-03-23

### Features

- **Quick spec mode** — `/zie-spec "idea"` accepts inline ideas directly,
  no backlog file needed. Detects spaces in argument, derives slug, jumps
  straight to spec-design.
- **Hybrid release** — `/zie-release` delegates publish to `make release
  NEW=<v>`. Makefile templates ship a `ZIE-NOT-READY` skeleton; `/zie-init`
  negotiates a project-appropriate skeleton on first run. Readiness gate
  prevents accidental skeleton execution.
- **Reviewer context bundles** — All three reviewers gain a Phase 1
  context load (named files, ADRs, project/context.md, ROADMAP) and Phase 3
  checks: file existence, ADR conflict, ROADMAP conflict, pattern match.

### Fixed

- `project/decisions.md` renamed to `project/context.md` — avoids naming
  collision with `decisions/` ADR directory. All templates + tests updated.
- `/zie-init` deep scan `knowledge_hash` now stable (dir tree + file counts
  + config files SHA-256). Used by `/zie-resync` for drift detection.
- Post-release pipeline audit: 33 issues (6 critical, 16 important, 11 minor)
  fixed across all 10 commands, 10 skills, and hooks. ADR-003 + ADR-004
  written.

### Changed

- SDLC pipeline redesigned to 6 stages with reviewer quality gates at every
  handoff. `superpowers_enabled` removed — framework is fully self-contained.
- Markdownlint: default config (MD013 line-length no longer overridden).

## v1.2.0 — 2026-03-23

### Features

- **6-stage SDLC pipeline** — replaced 3-stage (idea/build/ship) with
  backlog→spec→plan→implement→release→retro; single-responsibility commands
- **Reviewer quality gates** — `spec-reviewer`, `plan-reviewer`, `impl-reviewer`
  skills dispatch as subagents at each handoff (max 3 iterations → surface to human)
- **zie-init deep scan** — Agent(Explore) scan on existing projects populates
  PROJECT.md and project/* with real data instead of placeholder templates
- **Knowledge drift detection** — `knowledge_hash` stored at init/resync time;
  `/zie-status` warns when project files changed outside SDLC process
- **/zie-resync command** — manual trigger for full codebase rescan + doc update

### Fixes

- Remove all `superpowers_enabled` references — framework fully self-contained
- Fix markdownlint errors across all .md files; add pre-commit lint gate
- Update intent-detect hook for new pipeline command names

### Docs

## v1.1.0 — 2026-03-22

### Features

- **Knowledge Architecture** — Every project using zie-framework gets
  `PROJECT.md` (hub) and `project/architecture.md`, `project/components.md`,
  `project/decisions.md` (spokes), auto-generated by `/zie-init` from
  templates — no manual setup required.
- **Project Decisions log** — Records architectural decisions as an
  append-only log with status (Accepted / Superseded). `/zie-retro` syncs
  entries to brain automatically.

### Changed

- **Commands redesigned** — All `/zie-*` commands and skills use
  intent-driven language; phases renamed (e.g., "Write the failing test first
  (RED)").
- **Batch release support** — `[x]` items in the Now lane accumulate pending
  release. `/zie-ship` moves them to Done with a version tag — no need to
  ship features individually. *(command removed in v1.2.0 — use `/zie-release`)*
- **Intent-driven steps** — RED/GREEN/REFACTOR in `/zie-build` are short
  paragraphs instead of bullet micro-steps; config reads collapsed to one
  line. *(command removed in v1.2.0 — use `/zie-implement`)*
- **Version bump suggestion** — `/zie-ship` analyzes the Now lane and git log
  then suggests major/minor/patch with reasoning before confirmation.
- **Human-readable CHANGELOG** — `/zie-ship` drafts the CHANGELOG entry for
  approval before committing.

### Tests

- 165 unit tests covering commands, skills, hooks, and templates (pytest).
