# /sprint — Sprint Clear (Backlog → Ship → Retro)

<!-- preflight: full -->

Run a complete sprint cycle: spec+plan all items concurrently (no cap), implement sequentially (WIP=1), batch release once, single retro. Delta-only progress during Phase 1; full table at phase end.

## ตรวจสอบก่อนเริ่ม

See [Pre-flight standard](../zie-framework/project/command-conventions.md#pre-flight) (checks all 3 steps + WIP guard).

4. Check current branch is `dev`.
5. Verify no uncommitted changes (warn if found).
6. Check `.zie/handoff.md` — if present, read it. Use its Goals, Key Decisions,
   and Constraints as context brief for this sprint run. After the sprint
   completes successfully (after retro), delete `.zie/handoff.md`.
   If handoff.md is malformed (missing frontmatter) → warn and fall back to
   manual prompt mode.
7. **Sprint resume check** — Read `zie-framework/.sprint-state` if it exists:
   - Parse JSON: `{phase, items, completed_phases, remaining_items, started_at}`
   - If found, ask: `"Incomplete sprint found (phase {phase}/4, {N} items remaining). Resume? (yes / restart)"`
   - `yes` → skip audit, jump to the phase stored in state, use remaining_items
     - If phase=2: print `[resume] Phase 2 — skipping completed: <items \ remaining_items> | resuming from: <first of remaining_items>`
   - `restart` → delete `.sprint-state`, proceed with fresh sprint
   - If file is malformed → delete it, proceed fresh

## Arguments

| Flag / Positional | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `slugs` (positional) | Space-separated backlog slugs to process; omit to process all Next+Ready items | all items |
| `--dry-run` | Print sprint audit table and stop — do not execute | off |
| `--skip-ready` | Skip items already in Ready lane (spec+plan approved) | off |
| `--version=X.Y.Z` | Override version bump for Phase 3 release | auto |

Flag handling is inline at each consuming step below.

## "All" means ALL — No Silent Drops

When the user says "do all of these", "ทำทั้งหมด", "sprint ทั้งหมด", or provides a list without exclusions:
- **Every item in the list (or in Next+Ready) MUST be included.** No item may be silently dropped.
- The sprint audit table MUST show every item. Missing items = error.

**Item consolidation (allowed, but must be declared):**
Small items CAN be merged into a single backlog entry when they: (a) share a single file/component, (b) each takes < 15 min, and (c) have no spec or plan yet. When merging:
1. Create one combined backlog file covering all merged items.
2. Print before the audit table:
   ```
   [MERGED] <slug-a> + <slug-b> → <combined-slug>
   Reason: both touch <X> and are trivially small.
   Original items: <slug-a> (<title>), <slug-b> (<title>)
   ```
3. The combined backlog `## Problem` must reference all original items by name.
4. Never merge items with existing specs/plans, different domains, or HIGH/CRITICAL priority.

## Step 0: AUDIT — Build Sprint Plan

1. **Read ROADMAP lanes**:
   - **Next**: items awaiting spec
   - **Ready**: items with approved plan, awaiting impl
   - **Now**: active work (should be empty at sprint start)
   - **Done**: shipped

2. **Classify items**:

   For each slug in Next + Ready lanes:
   - Check `zie-framework/backlog/<slug>.md` exists → `[backlog: ✓]`
   - Glob `zie-framework/specs/*-<slug>-design.md` + read frontmatter → `[spec: ✓/pending]`
   - Glob `zie-framework/plans/*-<slug>.md` + read frontmatter → `[plan: ✓/pending]`
   - Check if item in Now → `[impl: ✓/—]`

3. **Compute phase assignment**:

   ```
   needs_spec = Next items without approved spec
   needs_plan = (Next+Ready items with approved spec) \ Ready items with approved plan
   ready_impl = Ready items with approved plan
   ```

4. **Check for dependencies**:

   - Scan all backlog files for `<!-- depends_on: slug-N -->` comments
   - Build dependency graph
   - Items with dependencies → mark for serialization in PLAN/IMPL phases

5. **Compute suggested version** (pre-computed at sprint start):

   ```python
   import subprocess
   result = subprocess.run(
       ["git", "log", "--oneline", "--grep=^release:"],
       capture_output=True, text=True, cwd=str(cwd)
   )
   releases = result.stdout.strip().split("\n") if result.stdout.strip() else []
   last_version = "1.0.0"
   if releases:
       import re
       m = re.search(r"v?(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)", releases[0])
       if m:
           last_version = m.group(1)
   # Bump patch
   parts = list(map(int, last_version.split(".")))
   parts[2] += 1
   suggested_version = ".".join(map(str, parts))
   ```

   Store in `.zie/sprint-state.json`: `"suggested_version": "<version>"`

6. **Print sprint audit table**:

   ```
   SPRINT AUDIT

   Needs Spec:  <count> items
   Needs Plan:  <count> items
   Ready to Impl: <count> items
   Dependencies: <count> edges (if any)
   Suggested version: v<suggested_version>

   [item1] backlog ✓ | spec — | plan — | impl —
   [item2] backlog ✓ | spec ✓ | plan — | impl —
   [item3] backlog ✓ | spec ✓ | plan ✓ | impl —
   ...
   ```

7. **--dry-run branch**: if `--dry-run` present → print audit table and stop. Say "Run without --dry-run to execute."

8. **User confirmation**:

   ```
   Sprint ready. Process:
   - Phase 1: Spec <N> items (parallel, with inline retry on partial failure)
   - Phase 2: Impl <N> items (sequential, WIP=1)
   - Phase 3: Release v<suggested-version> (pre-computed)
   - Phase 4: Retro

   Start sprint? (yes / edit / cancel)
   ```

   - `yes` → continue to Phase 1
   - `edit` → ask which items to include/skip (filter slugs)
   - `cancel` → stop

## Load Context Bundle (Once Per Sprint)

<!-- context: ROADMAP already injected by session-resume/subagent-context hook; re-read only if Now lane may have changed -->

Invoke `Skill(zie-framework:load-context)` → result available as `context_bundle`
(reads `decisions/*.md` ADRs + `project/context.md`).

## Autonomous Mode

Set `autonomous_mode=true` for all downstream skill invocations.
This flag suppresses interactive turns, approval gates, and agent spawns in spec-design, write-plan, and retro.

**Interruption Protocol** — sprint pauses for user only in 3 cases:
1. Backlog clarity score < 2 → ask 1 question per vague item, then continue
2. Auto-fix failed after 1 retry → surface issue + interrupt
3. Unresolvable dependency conflict between items → ask once before Phase 1

**Clarity scoring** (per Next item needing spec — computed in Step 0 AUDIT):
- +1 if `## Problem` has ≥ 2 sentences
- +1 if `## Rough Scope` has content
- +1 if title names a concrete action ("add X", "fix Y", "remove Z")
- Score ≥ 2 → `[clarity: direct]` — write spec without Q&A
- Score < 2 → `[clarity: ask]` — ask 1 clarifying question first, then write

## PHASE 1: SPEC ALL (Parallel)

TaskCreate subject="Phase 1/4 — Spec All"

For `[clarity: ask]` items: ask 1 question per item first, then proceed.

For each item in needs_spec (all launched concurrently — parallel Skill calls, passing `context_bundle`):
1. `Skill(zie-framework:spec-design, '<slug> autonomous')` — writes spec, runs spec-reviewer inline, auto-approves
2. After spec approved: `Skill(zie-framework:write-plan, '<slug>')` — writes plan
3. Inline plan-reviewer: invoke `Skill(zie-framework:plan-reviewer, context_bundle=<context_bundle>)` in current context — no Agent spawn
   - ✅ APPROVED → run `python3 hooks/approve.py <plan-file>` via Bash (reviewer-gate blocks Write/Edit — this is the ONLY allowed approval path), then move ROADMAP Next → Ready automatically
   - ❌ Issues Found → fix inline (1 pass, then re-check once) → re-run approve.py on pass
   - Second failure → interrupt (Interruption Protocol case 2)

No intermediate general-purpose Agent spawn. Skills run directly in sprint context.
On failure: inline retry once → if still failing → interrupt (Interruption Protocol case 2).

Print: `"Phase 1: Speccing <N> items in parallel (all concurrent)..."`

**Progress reporting (delta-only):** As each agent completes, print a single
line: `[spec N/total] <slug> ✓` or `[spec N/total] <slug> ❌ <issue>`.
Do NOT print a full tracker table on each completion — only print the full
status table once, after all agents have finished (or after retry exhausted).

Wait for all Phase 1 agents → collect results.
- Each spec result: approved → mark in audit
- Any partial failure (spec+plan chain incomplete) → inline retry: re-spawn a single
  sequential agent for each failed slug (no separate phase — retry happens before
  progress bar prints). If retry also fails → print error, halt sprint.

After Phase 1 (+ any retries): reload ROADMAP → bind as `roadmap_post_phase1`.

**Write sprint context bundle** (Phase 1→2→3 passthrough):
```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

sprint_context = {
    "specs": {...},    # Spec content for each item (keyed by slug)
    "plans": {...},    # Plan content for each item (keyed by slug)
    "roadmap": roadmap_post_phase1,
    "context_bundle": context_bundle,  # From load-context skill
}
bundle_path = cwd / ".zie" / "sprint-context.json"
bundle_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
bundle_path.write_text(json.dumps(sprint_context))
```

TaskUpdate → Phase 1/4 complete
Write `zie-framework/.sprint-state` → `{"phase": 2, "items": <all_slugs>, "completed_phases": [1], "remaining_items": <ready_slugs>, "current_task": "", "tdd_phase": "", "last_action": "spec-done", "started_at": <iso_ts>}`
Print progress bar: `{"█" * done_blocks}{"░" * empty_blocks} {done}/{total} ({pct}%)`
Print ETA: `Phase 1/4 — 3 phases remaining`

**Context checkpoint:** Run `/compact` now to clear Phase 1 conversation history before implementation.

## PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT (Sequential, WIP=1)

TaskCreate subject="Phase 2/4 — Implement"

**Read sprint context bundle** (Phase 1→2 passthrough):
```python
import json
bundle_path = cwd / ".zie" / "sprint-context.json"
if bundle_path.exists():
    sprint_context = json.loads(bundle_path.read_text())
    # Use specs/plans from bundle — no disk re-read
else:
    sprint_context = {}  # Fallback: read from disk (resume case)
```

Read Ready items from `roadmap_post_phase1` (ordered by priority: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW). Re-read ROADMAP only if a mutation occurred after Phase 1.

For each item in priority order:

1. Move item from Ready → Now in ROADMAP
   Update `.sprint-state`: `current_task = <slug>`, `tdd_phase = ""`, `last_action = "impl-start"`
2. Run implement agent via Bash (same pattern as Phase 3 release — fresh context, agent mode):
   ```bash
   make zie-implement
   ```
   The agent reads the Now lane from ROADMAP, implements, commits, and exits.
   **Context passthrough:** Pass `sprint_context["plans"].get(<slug>)` to implement agent if available.
3. After Bash returns, check ROADMAP.md — Now item marked `[x]` and committed → success.
   `[impl N/total] <slug> ✓ <commit>`
   Update `.sprint-state`: `remaining_items` = previous `remaining_items` minus `<slug>`, `current_task = ""`, `last_action = "impl-done:<slug>"`
   (write immediately so resume can skip this item if context overflows before next item)
   If this is not the last item: run `/compact` → print `[compact] context cleared after <slug>`
   Update `.sprint-state`: `last_action = "compact-after:<slug>"`
4. Non-zero exit or Now lane still active: `[impl N/total] <slug> ❌ <issue>` → halt sprint

After all impl complete: all items marked `[x]` in Now.
TaskUpdate → Phase 2/4 complete
Write `zie-framework/.sprint-state` → `{"phase": 3, "items": <all_slugs>, "completed_phases": [1, 2], "remaining_items": [], "current_task": "release", "tdd_phase": "", "last_action": "release-start", "suggested_version": "<version>", "started_at": <iso_ts>}`
Print progress bar: `{"█" * done_blocks}{"░" * empty_blocks} {done}/{total} ({pct}%)`
Print ETA: `Phase 2/4 — 2 phases remaining`

**Context checkpoint:** Run `/compact` now to clear implementation history before release.

## PHASE 3: BATCH RELEASE

TaskCreate subject="Phase 3/4 — Release"

**Read sprint context bundle** (Phase 1→2→3 passthrough):
```python
import json
bundle_path = cwd / ".zie" / "sprint-context.json"
if bundle_path.exists():
    sprint_context = json.loads(bundle_path.read_text())
    # Use specs/plans from bundle for release notes
else:
    sprint_context = {}  # Fallback: read from disk
```

**Read pre-computed version** from sprint state:
```python
import json
state_path = cwd / ".zie" / "sprint-state.json"
if state_path.exists():
    state = json.loads(state_path.read_text())
    version = state.get("suggested_version", "auto")
else:
    version = "auto"  # Fallback: compute at release time
```

Invoke `/release`:

```bash
zie-release --bump-to=<version>
```

With version override if provided (overrides pre-computed):

```bash
zie-release --bump-to=<version_override>
```

**Context passthrough:** Pass `sprint_context["specs"]` and `sprint_context["plans"]` to release for generating release notes from approved content.

Print: `"Phase 4: Batch release..."`
TaskUpdate → Phase 3/4 complete
Write `zie-framework/.sprint-state` → `{"phase": 4, "items": <all_slugs>, "completed_phases": [1, 2, 3], "remaining_items": [], "current_task": "", "tdd_phase": "", "last_action": "release-done", "started_at": <iso_ts>}`
Print progress bar: `{"█" * done_blocks}{"░" * empty_blocks} {done}/{total} ({pct}%)`
Print ETA: `Phase 3/4 — 1 phase remaining`

## PHASE 4: SPRINT RETRO (auto)

TaskCreate subject="Phase 4/4 — Retro"

Auto-invoke retro inline — no user prompt. Retro runs automatically in light mode
(ROADMAP Done + ADR-000-summary only). Full ADR writing triggered only if any shipped
plan contains `<!-- adr: required -->`.

```bash
zie-retro
```

Print: `"Phase 4: Sprint retro (automatically)..."`
TaskUpdate → Phase 4/4 complete
Delete `zie-framework/.sprint-state` (sprint complete — no resume needed)
Print progress bar: `████████████████████ 4/4 (100%)`
Print ETA: `Sprint complete`

## Error Handling

- **Phase 1 fails** (retry exhausted): halt sprint, surface issue. User can fix and restart from that item.
- **Phase 2 fails**: halt sprint, invoke `/fix`, re-implement.
- **Phase 3 fails**: halt before merge, print error. User can debug and retry release manually.
- **Phase 4 fails**: non-blocking, print warning. Retro can be run manually later.
