# /sprint — Sprint Clear (Backlog → Ship → Retro)

Run a complete sprint cycle: spec+plan all items concurrently (no cap), implement sequentially (WIP=1), batch release once, single retro. Delta-only progress during Phase 1; full table at phase end.

## ตรวจสอบก่อนเริ่ม

1. Check `zie-framework/` exists → if not, tell user to run `/init` first.
2. Read `zie-framework/.config` → zie_memory_enabled, project_type.
3. Read `zie-framework/ROADMAP.md` → check all lanes.
4. Check current branch is `dev`.
5. Verify no uncommitted changes (warn if found).
6. Check `.zie/handoff.md` — if present, read it. Use its Goals, Key Decisions,
   and Constraints as context brief for this sprint run. After the sprint
   completes successfully (after retro), delete `.zie/handoff.md`.
   If handoff.md is malformed (missing frontmatter) → warn and fall back to
   manual prompt mode.
7. **Sprint resume check** — Read `zie-framework/.sprint-state` if it exists:
   - Parse JSON: `{phase, items, completed_phases, remaining_items, started_at}`
   - If found, ask: `"Incomplete sprint found (phase {phase}/4, {N} items remaining). Resume? (yes / restart)"`
   - `yes` → skip audit, jump to the phase stored in state, use remaining_items
   - `restart` → delete `.sprint-state`, proceed with fresh sprint
   - If file is malformed → delete it, proceed fresh

## Arguments

| Flag / Positional | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `slugs` (positional) | Space-separated backlog slugs to process; omit to process all Next+Ready items | all items |
| `--dry-run` | Print sprint audit table and stop — do not execute | off |
| `--skip-ready` | Skip items already in Ready lane (spec+plan approved) | off |
| `--version=X.Y.Z` | Override version bump for Phase 3 release | auto |

Flag handling is inline at each consuming step below.

## "All" means ALL — No Silent Drops

When the user says "do all of these", "ทำทั้งหมด", "sprint ทั้งหมด", or provides a list without exclusions:
- **Every item in the list (or in Next+Ready) MUST be included.** No item may be silently dropped.
- The sprint audit table MUST show every item. Missing items = error.

**Item consolidation (allowed, but must be declared):**
Small items CAN be merged into a single backlog entry when they: (a) share a single file/component, (b) each takes < 15 min, and (c) have no spec or plan yet. When merging:
1. Create one combined backlog file covering all merged items.
2. Print before the audit table:
   ```
   [MERGED] <slug-a> + <slug-b> → <combined-slug>
   Reason: both touch <X> and are trivially small.
   Original items: <slug-a> (<title>), <slug-b> (<title>)
   ```
3. The combined backlog `## Problem` must reference all original items by name.
4. Never merge items with existing specs/plans, different domains, or HIGH/CRITICAL priority.

## Step 0: AUDIT — Build Sprint Plan

1. **Read ROADMAP lanes**:
   - **Next**: items awaiting spec
   - **Ready**: items with approved plan, awaiting impl
   - **Now**: active work (should be empty at sprint start)
   - **Done**: shipped

2. **Classify items**:

   For each slug in Next + Ready lanes:
   - Check `zie-framework/backlog/<slug>.md` exists → `[backlog: ✓]`
   - Glob `zie-framework/specs/*-<slug>-design.md` + read frontmatter → `[spec: ✓/pending]`
   - Glob `zie-framework/plans/*-<slug>.md` + read frontmatter → `[plan: ✓/pending]`
   - Check if item in Now → `[impl: ✓/—]`

3. **Compute phase assignment**:

   ```
   needs_spec = Next items without approved spec
   needs_plan = (Next+Ready items with approved spec) \ Ready items with approved plan
   ready_impl = Ready items with approved plan
   ```

4. **Check for dependencies**:

   - Scan all backlog files for `<!-- depends_on: slug-N -->` comments
   - Build dependency graph
   - Items with dependencies → mark for serialization in PLAN/IMPL phases

5. **Print sprint audit table**:

   ```
   SPRINT AUDIT

   Needs Spec:  <count> items
   Needs Plan:  <count> items
   Ready to Impl: <count> items
   Dependencies: <count> edges (if any)

   [item1] backlog ✓ | spec — | plan — | impl —
   [item2] backlog ✓ | spec ✓ | plan — | impl —
   [item3] backlog ✓ | spec ✓ | plan ✓ | impl —
   ...
   ```

6. **--dry-run branch**: if `--dry-run` present → print audit table and stop. Say "Run without --dry-run to execute."

7. **User confirmation**:

   ```
   Sprint ready. Process:
   - Phase 1: Spec <N> items (parallel, with inline retry on partial failure)
   - Phase 2: Impl <N> items (sequential, WIP=1)
   - Phase 3: Release v<suggested-version>
   - Phase 4: Retro

   Start sprint? (yes / edit / cancel)
   ```

   - `yes` → continue to Phase 1
   - `edit` → ask which items to include/skip (filter slugs)
   - `cancel` → stop

## Load Context Bundle (Once Per Sprint)

Invoke `Skill(zie-framework:load-context)` → result available as `context_bundle`
(reads `decisions/*.md` ADRs + `project/context.md`).

## Autonomous Mode

Set `autonomous_mode=true` for all downstream skill invocations.
This flag suppresses interactive turns, approval gates, and agent spawns in spec-design, write-plan, and retro.

**Interruption Protocol** — sprint pauses for user only in 3 cases:
1. Backlog clarity score < 2 → ask 1 question per vague item, then continue
2. Auto-fix failed after 1 retry → surface issue + interrupt
3. Unresolvable dependency conflict between items → ask once before Phase 1

**Clarity scoring** (per Next item needing spec — computed in Step 0 AUDIT):
- +1 if `## Problem` has ≥ 2 sentences
- +1 if `## Rough Scope` has content
- +1 if title names a concrete action ("add X", "fix Y", "remove Z")
- Score ≥ 2 → `[clarity: direct]` — write spec without Q&A
- Score < 2 → `[clarity: ask]` — ask 1 clarifying question first, then write

## PHASE 1: SPEC ALL (Parallel)

TaskCreate subject="Phase 1/4 — Spec All"

For `[clarity: ask]` items: ask 1 question per item first, then proceed.

For each item in needs_spec (all launched concurrently — parallel Skill calls, passing `context_bundle`):
1. `Skill(zie-framework:spec-design, '<slug> autonomous')` — writes spec, runs spec-reviewer inline, auto-approves
2. After spec approved: `Skill(zie-framework:write-plan, '<slug>')` — writes plan
3. Inline plan-reviewer: invoke `Skill(zie-framework:plan-reviewer, context_bundle=<context_bundle>)` in current context — no Agent spawn
   - ✅ APPROVED → run `python3 hooks/approve.py <plan-file>` via Bash (reviewer-gate blocks Write/Edit — this is the ONLY allowed approval path), then move ROADMAP Next → Ready automatically
   - ❌ Issues Found → fix inline (1 pass) → re-check → re-run approve.py on pass
   - Second failure → interrupt (Interruption Protocol case 2)

No intermediate general-purpose Agent spawn. Skills run directly in sprint context.
On failure: inline retry once → if still failing → interrupt (Interruption Protocol case 2).

Print: `"Phase 1: Speccing <N> items in parallel (all concurrent)..."`

**Progress reporting (delta-only):** As each agent completes, print a single
line: `[spec N/total] <slug> ✓` or `[spec N/total] <slug> ❌ <issue>`.
Do NOT print a full tracker table on each completion — only print the full
status table once, after all agents have finished (or after retry exhausted).

Wait for all Phase 1 agents → collect results.
- Each spec result: approved → mark in audit
- Any partial failure (spec+plan chain incomplete) → inline retry: re-spawn a single
  sequential agent for each failed slug (no separate phase — retry happens before
  progress bar prints). If retry also fails → print error, halt sprint.

After Phase 1 (+ any retries): reload ROADMAP → bind as `roadmap_post_phase1`.
TaskUpdate → Phase 1/4 complete
Write `zie-framework/.sprint-state` → `{"phase": 2, "items": <all_slugs>, "completed_phases": [1], "remaining_items": <ready_slugs>, "started_at": <iso_ts>}`
Print progress bar: `{"█" * done_blocks}{"░" * empty_blocks} {done}/{total} ({pct}%)`
Print ETA: `Phase 1/4 — 3 phases remaining`

**Context checkpoint:** Run `/compact` now to clear Phase 1 conversation history before implementation.

## PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT (Sequential, WIP=1)

TaskCreate subject="Phase 2/4 — Implement"

Read Ready items from `roadmap_post_phase1` (ordered by priority: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW). Re-read ROADMAP only if a mutation occurred after Phase 1.

For each item in priority order:

1. Move item from Ready → Now in ROADMAP
2. Read `zie-framework/plans/*-<slug>.md` (only this file per item)
3. Invoke: `Skill(zie-framework:zie-implement, <slug>, context_bundle=<context_bundle>)`
4. Success: `[impl N/total] <slug> ✓ <commit>`
5. Failure: `[impl N/total] <slug> ❌ <issue>` → halt sprint

After all impl complete: all items marked `[x]` in Now.
TaskUpdate → Phase 2/4 complete
Write `zie-framework/.sprint-state` → `{"phase": 3, "items": <all_slugs>, "completed_phases": [1, 2], "remaining_items": [], "started_at": <iso_ts>}`
Print progress bar: `{"█" * done_blocks}{"░" * empty_blocks} {done}/{total} ({pct}%)`
Print ETA: `Phase 2/4 — 2 phases remaining`

**Context checkpoint:** Run `/compact` now to clear implementation history before release.

## PHASE 3: BATCH RELEASE

TaskCreate subject="Phase 3/4 — Release"

Invoke `/release`:

```bash
zie-release
```

With version override if provided:

```bash
zie-release --bump-to=<version_override>
```

Print: `"Phase 4: Batch release..."`
TaskUpdate → Phase 3/4 complete
Write `zie-framework/.sprint-state` → `{"phase": 4, "items": <all_slugs>, "completed_phases": [1, 2, 3], "remaining_items": [], "started_at": <iso_ts>}`
Print progress bar: `{"█" * done_blocks}{"░" * empty_blocks} {done}/{total} ({pct}%)`
Print ETA: `Phase 3/4 — 1 phase remaining`

## PHASE 4: SPRINT RETRO (auto)

TaskCreate subject="Phase 4/4 — Retro"

Auto-invoke retro inline — no user prompt. Retro runs automatically in light mode
(ROADMAP Done + ADR-000-summary only). Full ADR writing triggered only if any shipped
plan contains `<!-- adr: required -->`.

```bash
zie-retro
```

Print: `"Phase 4: Sprint retro (automatically)..."`
TaskUpdate → Phase 4/4 complete
Delete `zie-framework/.sprint-state` (sprint complete — no resume needed)
Print progress bar: `████████████████████ 4/4 (100%)`
Print ETA: `Sprint complete`

## Error Handling

- **Phase 1 fails** (retry exhausted): halt sprint, surface issue. User can fix and restart from that item.
- **Phase 2 fails**: halt sprint, invoke `/fix`, re-implement.
- **Phase 3 fails**: halt before merge, print error. User can debug and retry release manually.
- **Phase 4 fails**: non-blocking, print warning. Retro can be run manually later.
